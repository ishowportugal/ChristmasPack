Yes, you heard it right: the ultimate christmas pack. Im just so happy that I was finally able to find a xsnow alternative for Windows. 
Have fun celebrating Christmas/the new year with these awesome apps and shell scripts!


Edit: I apologise for not including the bash script for tree-EN.sh. Here it is:
